- Use simple reply templates
- Enable all safety features
- Start with headless mode disabled to watch the bot

INTERMEDIATE SETUP:
- Increase action limits gradually
- Add more search queries
- Use contextual replies
- Enable trend following

ADVANCED SETUP:
- Fine-tune engagement scoring

SAFETY TIPS:
1. Always start with very low limits
2. Monitor your account for any issues
3. Use realistic human-like delays
4. Avoid engaging with controversial content
